# Churn Rate Analysis

## Introduction

Our group has chosen to work on exploring and predicting telecom churn (which refers to when a customer left the service), as for telecom companies, retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Problem Definition

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service

What are the most significant factors that can affect the churn rate of telecom customers? 

Our group aims to solve this problem by using Exploratory Data Analysis, then developing a machine learning model that displays the significant predictors for churn, based on customersâ€™ historical usage data, demographics and other relevant features, and provide recommendations for possible reduction in churn rates.

## Data Preparation

Finding out type of data for each column

Filtering out data we deem irrelevant

Converted predictor variable to binary numeric variable for easier comparison

Created dummy dataset for simpler comparison and for later usage in machine learning techniques

Plotted correlation of all factors against the predictor (Customer Status)

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression Model
2. 
3. Random Forest Model

## Findings

We are able to gain insight into the customer demographics of the telecom company

From the Regression Models, we managed to pinpoint the important factors which are contract length, total tenure and number of referrals.

## Conclusion

Telecom churn rates depend on many different factors. We have managed to pinpoint the more significant ones and come up with solutions that telecom companies can make use of to reduce their churn rate.
